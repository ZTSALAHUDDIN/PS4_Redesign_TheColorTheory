Website Redesign

This repository contains the redesigned version of problem statement 4. The focus is on clean design, readability, and user experience while keeping all original functionality.

🔥 Original Issues
	•	Cluttered layout: 15+ sections with little spacing
	•	Color overload: Too many bright gradients
	•	Heavy effects: Shadows, hover scales, gradients overused
	•	Text hierarchy issues: Inconsistent sizes and spacing
	•	Poor readability: White text on busy backgrounds
	•	Repetitive layouts: Grid cards everywhere
	•	Navigation problems: No sticky navbar or section anchors
	•	Dense footer: Too much text, same font weight

✨ Redesign Highlights

	•	Added whitespace, consistent margins & section dividers 🧱
	•	Subtle shadows & hover effects only on key elements ✨
	•	Standardized typography & spacing 📝
